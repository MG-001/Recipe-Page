      <ol class = "instructions-list">
        <li><b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>    
        <li><b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>    
        <li><b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>    
        <li><b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li><b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>    
        <li><b>Enjoy:</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
